        2. How do you increase the clinic profitability?
      </h2>
      <p className="questionAnswer__content">
        The clinic profitability is increased due to:
        <br /> • tracking of all financial transactions that will help you to
        eliminate “gray” schemes;
        <br /> • monitoring the physicians' performance;
        <br /> • reporting automation resulting in more patients which a
        physician will be able to see;
        <br /> • treatment progress tracking that will increase patient loyalty
        and positively influence their recommendations and return visits.
