        Based on the initial survey, the platform offers the patient to take the
        necessary tests and make an appointment with a doctor, in this regard,
        there is no need for MedData integration with the call center.
        <br />
        <br />
        After the doctor's recommendations, the patient receives a notification
        in the MedData application, in the “My treatment tracking” option, where
        he can see all the physician prescriptions, and will also receive timely
        reminders which will allow him to perform the prescribed procedures in
        time.
